1. Clicking a filter goes to # (don't want it to move to top of page)
2. Adding class 'highlight-filter' doesn't add background color
3. Add Rankings link next to About, Blog...etc
4. Change Submit button for comment (can't see text)
5. Width of minimized songs...don't know what I messed up in the CSS
6. Shouldn't be allowed to resize comments area
