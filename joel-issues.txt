3. Add Rankings link next to About, Blog...etc
8. When the title for the rankings is too big, it goes onto the next line and looks terrible. Ex. If someone seaches for some long search term
9. Center 'Sorry there are no results' message 
10. Fade open/close for songs on click
11. Have score on maxed song line up with the other scores (far right of row), and have up/down vote buttons above and below it.
12. Somehow need to show that you can click certains pieces of text (ex. Genre in the song's info)
    aka style links
14. Upload box: line up old song checkbox next to text instead of below
16. Fade comments in/out
18. When I paste a long url into the uploads it moves the screen write a cuts off some of the boxes
19. Gray box behind logo on maxed queue
=============NEW==========
1. Make max queue and user queue scrollable so they don't overflow
2. In Queue: 1 song per line, if song + artist is too long, want it to end in (...)
3. Style highlighted/hover song in queue
4. Style delete buttons in user queue
5. Site icon
6. Styling of songs in min-queue
7. Open ' Made Of Sun (Stoneface & Terminal Remix)' by Kyau & Albert...for some reason it expands the whole page not just to the end of the rankings
8. When the queue is open, the logo has an area of gray the right of it if the song is too long
9. Submit Comment - Submit is styled but 'comment' is not, in white right below the button
10. Style user Scores
11. When content is floated right, the bottom banner is messed up
12. Floating player over resets song, need to float everything except player
13. A maxed song from the search results has the wrong width
14. Go to http://www.ajaxload.info/, create the loading icon you think looks best. Set up a div for it (kind of lightbox over the rankings) and it's display initially hidden. Let me know the class name and I'll activate it via a click
