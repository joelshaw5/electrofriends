4. Change Submit button for comment (can't see text)
5. Width of minimized songs...don't know what I messed up in the CSS
6. Shouldn't be allowed to resize comments area
7. When Show More Songs button is disabled, the bottom border of the rankings is gone
8. When the title for the rankings is too big, it goes onto the next line and looks terrible. Ex. If someone seaches for some long search term
9. Center 'Sorry there are no results' message 
10. Fade open/close for songs on click
11. Have score on maxed song line up with the other scores (far right of row), and have up/down vote buttons above and below it.
12. Somehow need to show that you can click certains pieces of text (ex. Genre in the song's info)
13. Drop down menu on upload page is too small, increase the size a little
14. Upload box: line up old song checkbox next to text instead of below
15. Report button
